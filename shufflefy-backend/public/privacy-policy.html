    <h2>Effective Date: 13/05/2025</h2>

    <p>At Shufflefy, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and store your data when you use our website and interact with Spotify's services through our integration.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide our services, we request the following Spotify user data through OAuth authentication:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User ID</strong>: A unique identifier associated with your Spotify account.</li>
        <li><strong>Playlist IDs</strong>: Identifiers for the playlists you create or follow on Spotify.</li>
        <li><strong>Playback State</strong>: Information about the currently playing track, including its progress, which we use to allow you to play, pause, seek, or change tracks.</li>
        <li><strong>Playback History</strong>: The songs you’ve listened to, which we use to tailor your experience (e.g., increasing the weight of songs that haven’t been played in a while).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We request access to the following Spotify scopes to enable these features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>user-read-playback-state</code></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the data collected from your Spotify account for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Playback Control</strong>: To allow you to control playback (e.g., play, pause, skip, seek, etc.) directly from our website.</li>
        <li><strong>Playlist Management</strong>: To access and display your playlists so that you can interact with them on our platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Song Weighting</strong>: We track the songs you have played to help us increase the weight of songs that haven’t been played recently, improving your experience by offering recommendations based on your listening history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention and Storage</h2>
    <p>We store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User ID</strong>: We store your Spotify User ID to personalize your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Playlist IDs</strong>: We store the Playlist IDs to remember which playlists you have interacted with.</li>
    </ul>
